# Zookeeper-Project
I built my own dynamic zoo monitoring system that allows zookeepers to visually track the well-being of animals across various habitats.
This is the Zookeeper (Python) project I made myself.

This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.
